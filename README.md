NLP Assignment Notebook

Overview

This repository contains an NLP assignment focused on training a pre-trained model like BERT from scratch. The notebook explores text embeddings for semantic similarity and adapts the loss function for Natural Language Inference (NLI) to improve the model's understanding of semantic relationships.

Installation

To run this notebook, install the required dependencies:

pip install pypdf
pip install -U langchain-community
pip install faiss-cpu
pip install sentence_transformers

Dependencies

The following libraries are required:

faiss

langchain

sentence_transformers

streamlit

numpy

Usage

Clone this repository.

Install dependencies using the commands above.

Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) in Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment.

Expected Output

The notebook processes NLP tasks, including:

Generating sentence embeddings

Performing retrieval-based QA using FAISS

Training/adapting loss functions for semantic similarity tasks
